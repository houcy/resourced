**ResourceD:** A single binary daemon that collects and report your server data with ease.

**NOTE: This documentation refers to master branch. For stable release, checkout the [main website](http://resourced.io/).**


## Installation

1. Download the binary release [here](https://github.com/resourced/resourced/releases).

2. Use supervisor/upstart/systemd to daemonize. [Click here for examples](https://github.com/resourced/resourced/tree/master/tests/script-init).


## Running the Server
```bash
RESOURCED_CONFIG_DIR=$GOPATH/src/github.com/resourced/resourced/tests/resourced-configs \
$GOPATH/bin/resourced
```

Once you executed the command above, open this URL: [http://localhost:55555/paths](http://localhost:55555/paths).
```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:55555/r/load-avg
```


## Configuration

ResourceD requires only 1 environment variable to run.

**RESOURCED_CONFIG_DIR:** Path to root config directory. If directory does not exist, it will be created.

In there, you will see the following subdirectories or files:

* `readers/` Put all the TOML configurations for readers here [(Example)](tests/resourced-configs/readers).

* `writers/` Put all the TOML configurations for writers here [(Example)](tests/resourced-configs/writers).

* `executors/` Put all the TOML configurations for executors here [(Example)](tests/resourced-configs/executors).

* `tags/` Each line in each file will be parsed as key=value tag [(Example)](tests/resourced-configs/tags).

* `general.toml` All default settings are defined in `general.toml`.


## Data Gathering

ResourceD `readers` gather data on your server. The easiest way to create a reader is to use a scripting language.

1. Write the script following this one requirement: **Output the JSON data through STDOUT**

2. Write config file. [Click here for examples](https://github.com/resourced/resourced/tree/master/tests/resourced-configs/readers).

### RESTful Endpoints

* **GET** `/` Displays full JSON data of all readers and writers.

* **GET** `/paths` Displays paths to all readers and writers data.

* **GET** `/r` Displays full JSON data of all readers.

* **GET** `/r/paths` Displays paths to all readers data.

* **GET** `/w` Displays full JSON data of all writers.

* **GET** `/w/paths` Displays paths to all writers data.
