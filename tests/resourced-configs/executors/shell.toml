# When using a scripting language,
# the script can access master's metadata API via HTTP. Examples:
# Given key is foo/bar,
#   POST   http://localhost:55655/api/metadata/foo/bar
#   GET    http://localhost:55655/api/metadata/foo/bar
#   DELETE http://localhost:55655/api/metadata/foo/bar
Command = "uptime"

# Example on how to read the following condition:
# 1. /r/load-avg is the JSON endpoint.
# 2. Dot (.) notation is used to drill deeper into the JSON nested structures.
# 3. You can use && or || for multiple conditions.
